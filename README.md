## About

This is my first portfolio web. In this web I use html5 with semantics , CSS3 with good practice & JavaScript with
lot of functionality. Mostly my main focus on this web was " How to create scrolling effect by using only css3/JavaScript" it did take a little bit time but as a programmer I find out solution.
Besides that I add other animation effects which leverage my skills & increases UI/UX of my web. This was my initial project & I know there are lot of things which needs to be perfect/better but as a initial level this is good according to my opinion. I learned lot of new things & gain a lot of experience.

##### The web is fully responsive for all devices & W3C validated with 0 errors & 0 warnings.
